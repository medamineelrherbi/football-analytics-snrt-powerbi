# ⚽ Power BI Project – Football Analytics for SNRT & Professional Teams

## 📌 Project Description

This Power BI project was developed as part of my work with SNRT (Moroccan Public broadcasting company) . It reflects my journey of **exploring data integration, cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power BI and DAX**. This initiative marked a **first-of-its-kind effort within SNRT**, driving the adoption of data-driven decision-making among media professionals and football clubs.

Due to **confidentiality agreements and sensitive data sourced from internal corporate databases**, I am **unable to share the Power BI file itself**. However, I’m showcasing key **dashboard screenshots** and providing a **complete breakdown** of its structure and logic to highlight my contributions and technical skills.
